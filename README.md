This server-client KeyValue takes in values and maps them in a hashtable

NOTES:

the keys can only me a continues phrases
words like "aaa a" will not work but "aaa" will work!

need to run server.java first then client.java

If there are any problems that result into infinite loops, restart the server and try again, for somereason it freezes.
